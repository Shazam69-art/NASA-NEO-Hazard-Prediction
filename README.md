This repository contains the NASA Near-Earth Object Hazard Prediction Model trained using a Random Forest classifier, wrapped inside a preprocessing pipeline for feature scaling and categorical encoding. The model is trained on a dataset of 18,168 near-Earth objects using features such as relative velocity, miss distance, estimated diameter (min/max), absolute magnitude, and sentry tracking status to identify the likelihood of a hazardous NEO. It achieves an accuracy of approximately 92%, with high performance in detecting non-hazardous objects and moderate recall for hazardous ones, making it a reliable early-risk assessment tool. The repository includes the model training script and the Gradio interface script — users can run the notebook and train the model themselves.
