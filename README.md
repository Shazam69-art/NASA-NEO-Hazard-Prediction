This Repo has the NEO Hazard Prediction Model using an ensemble approach combining Random Forest and XGBoost to maximize predictive performance; trained on a dataset of 18,168 Near-Earth Objects with features including velocity, distance, size, absolute magnitude, and sentry tracking status.
Model achieved an overall accuracy of 92%, with strong precision and recall for non-hazardous objects and moderate performance on hazardous ones, providing a robust tool for early hazard assessment.
I have uploaded only the training code and the interface code ( Train the model yourself )
